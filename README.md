## About the Project

The Crop Recommendation System is designed to provide farmers with crop recommendations based on input parameters such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The system utilizes a machine learning model, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, to make predictions.

## Features

- Predicts the most suitable crop based on user-input environmental parameters.
- Web-based user interface for easy interaction.
- High accuracy in crop predictions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask (Web Framework)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning Library)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Frontend)
- Joblib (Model Serialization)
- Other dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`

## Getting Started

To run the Crop Recommendation System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-recommendation-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd crop-recommendation-system
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the application in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Usage
Fill in the input fields with the environmental parameters.
Click the "Predict Crop" button.
View the recommended crop on the webpage.
